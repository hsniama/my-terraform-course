# 🚀 Terraform AWS Labs

Welcome to my personal series of hands-on labs where I build and manage AWS cloud infrastructure using **Terraform**, following real-world **DevOps** and **Cloud Engineering** practices.

Each lab is crafted to reinforce core **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** concepts while progressively increasing in complexity — from foundational VPC design to advanced modular architectures.
